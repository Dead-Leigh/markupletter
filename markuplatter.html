<h3> RE: Eileen Dover university application</h3>

<p>
	Thank you for your recent a recent application to join us at the University of Awesome’s science faculty to study as part of your <acronym>PhD</acronym> next year.  I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.

<!--  code pen said acronym is obsolete -->

</p>

	<h4>Start dates</h4>
<p>
	We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:

	<ul>
		<li>First semester: <time>9 September 2016</time></li>

		<li>Second semester:<time> 15 January 2017</time></li>

		<li>Third semester: <time>2 May 2017</time> </li>
	</ul>

	Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date would you prefer.

</p>

<p>
	You can find more information about <a href="http://example.com">important university dates</a> on our website
 </p>

	<h4>Subjects of study</h4>

	<p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility - as long as the subject fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we’d like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>

		<li>Measuring the effects on performance of funk bass players at temperatures exceeding 30C (86F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup>.) </li>

		<li><acronym>HTML</acronym> and <acronym>CSS</acronym> constructs for representing musical scores. </li>

<!--  code pen said acronym is obsolete -->

	</ol>
</p>

<p>
	So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you’d expect to research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we’d need to know? Thanks
</p>

<h4>Exotic dance moves</h4>

<p>
	Yes, you are right! As part of my postdoctoral work, I <em>did</em> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favorite dances are as follows, with definitions:

</p>

<p>
Polynesian chicken dance</br>
	<dl>
		<dd>A little know but <em>very</em> influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be “fruitful”</dd>
	</dl>
</p>

<p>
Iceland brownian shuffle
	<dl>
		<dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm,  they used to practice this dance, which involved holding close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern style such as Twerking</dd>
	</dl>
</p>

<p>
Arctic robot dance
	<dl>
		<dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovers a new dance style characterised by “robotic”,  stilted movement, being practiced by inhabitants of North Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.</dd>
	</dl>
</p>
